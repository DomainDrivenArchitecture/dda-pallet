Anyone who has dealt with Infrastructure as Code so far, has to deal with a mix of Ruby, Python and Go. If you want to get more from the Java world and if you always wanted to try functional programming, there is now a worthy & fresh alternative: "dda-pallet". Dda-pallet is open-source, written in Clojure and runs on the proven Java Virtual Machine.
Dda-pallet provides the whole tool-chain from one hand, is really modular, testable and well-prepared for the handling of configuration data.

## Compatibility
Dda-pallet is compatible with the following versions
 * pallet 0.8
 * clojure 1.7
 * (x)ubuntu14.04 / 16.04

## Principles
 * Distinction between installation and configuration: We distinguish between seldom installation and continuous configuration.
 * Explicit state: We collect all the system state information at a defined place.
 * Full modularization: We separate our modules into common usable system adapters and company specific convention modules. Beside this general principle we are using the full tool stack provided by Clojure.
 * Configuration is data: In order to keep the interface simple, clean & isolated, we handle all configuration as data. There is no hidden magic.
 * Test-driven DevOps: Configuration as data makes it easy, to do unit tests. For the system adapters we are heading towards state-of-the-art integration tests - comparable to Kitchen / Vagrant / Server-spec.
